-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--/ A Subquery or Inner query or Nested query is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the WHERE clause.
--/ A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.
--/ Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements along with the operators like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN etc.

-- There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:

-- Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
-- A subquery can have only one column in the SELECT clause, unless multiple columns are in the main query for the subquery to compare its selected columns.
